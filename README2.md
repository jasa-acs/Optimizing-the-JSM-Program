Supplementary_materials.zip contains the following files:
- inputdata_JSM.RData
- allocation_matrix_list.RData
- jsm_script.R
- abstract_program.xlsx
- distinctive_words.zip


The file "inputdata_JSM.RData" includes three datasets used in the analysis: "abstract_info" concerns the detailed information about the sessions of JSM 2020, "seeded_words" is the table of the seeded words we used in seeded LDA, and finally "trayvon_martin" is made up of all the words of Trayvon Martin Corpus we used in data cleaning. 

The file "allocation_matrix_list.RData" is a list of 100 allocation matrices we generated through our algorithm. We attached it to give the opportunity to avoid running the final loop (commented) and, consequently, save time.

The file "jsm_script.R" includes all the code for reproducing in R the analysis we carried out.

The file "abstract_program.xlsx" includes the information about the abstracts of JSM 2020 we used as input in the analysis.

The file "distinctive_words.zip" includes the distinctive words obtained with the sensitivity analysis.
